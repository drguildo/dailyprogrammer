Title: [MOD POST] New subreddit changes

**Hey /r/DailyProgrammer,**

First, as always, *thank you for subbing to us and being an awesome community*! In the last month we've grown by about 1k subscribers, have written many new challenges, and have implemented some awesome feedback from you!

We've been hard at work taking many of your suggestions and implementing them. We've implemented almost all recommendations, with only one recommendation left pending some user-support. The biggest changes are that challenges are now automatically posted and we've added an achievement / medals system as user-flair.

**Here's our detailed change-list:**

* The subreddit's theme has slightly changed
* The side-bar on /r/DailyProgrammer and /r/DailyProgrammer_Ideas have been updated
* We now will be posting three (3) challenges a week: Easy on Mondays, Intermediate on Wednesdays, and Hard on Fridays. This is reflect at the top-bar.
* We've re-doubled our efforts to making sure postings are super consistent: We've written and deployed a Pyton web-crawler that takes approved peer-reviewed challenges and queues them up for automatic submission. [Check out that mini-script here](https://github.com/nint22/DailyProgBot)!
* Problems will now have "challenge inputs and outputs" in addition to I/O format definition and sample I/O. "Challenge" I/O is a set of difficult or fully-featured test input, much like the sample I/O. The output is automatically hidden so you can't accidentally see results and cheat yourself at writing a solution. 
* Problem solutions may or may not be posted (up to the author), but mods will be more active in verifying user submissions. Mods who are unreasonably inactive will be kicked.
* A new achievement / medals system (*see below*). Two medals (gold and silver) will now replace your previous flair.

**Achievements System**

All users are assigned a pair of medals in their user flare: silver and gold medals. These medals are to show off the number of achievements you've earned, as decided by community members and our subreddit's moderators. These achievements are not for any particular "goal" (i.e. you can't earn them for writing "the best code"). Instead, you earn them by standing out, with either very elegant solutions, good programming-language discussions, or just writing a fun solution!

* *Gold Medals* are mostly for smart solutions, impressive designs, or demonstration of good CS / algorithmic skills. You automatically get a gold medal if your /r/DailyProgrammer_ideas challenge idea is accepted!

* *Silver Medals* are for neat tricks, cool optimizations, or even crazy-fun code.

If you're new to programming, or don't think you can write code that would stand-out, mods will be carefully tracking user's progressions. If you've improved a solution over time, or have a healthy question / discussion related to programming, you will absolutely earn some medals!

Because of some formatting / CSS issues, we will no longer support flair that just has the programming-language you choose. We'll try to re-integrate that feature over time.

**We need your help!**

Finally, we need your help for two final issues. 1. *We need more active mods!* and 2. *We need a user to take charge of a "long-term" challenge. If you're interested in being a mod, just PM us some information about yourself and what you can bring to the table. For the "long-term" challenge we're looking for great programming ideas that can be executed in a month-long format, where a simple solution should take a few hour, but a "great" solution can really be expanded and grown on the premise.

With all of this said, have a great week, and keep up the awesome work!
