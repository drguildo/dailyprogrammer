As all of us who have read "Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets" knows, the reason He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named chose his creepy moniker is that "I Am Lord Voldemort" is an anagram for his birthname, "Tom Marvolo Riddle". 

I've never been good at these kinds of word-games (like anagrams), I always find it hard to figure out that stuff manually. I find it much more enjoyable to write computer programs to solve these problems for me. In the spirit of that, today's problem is to find simple one-word anagrams for other words.

Write a program that given a word will find all one-word anagrams for that word. So, for instance, if you put in "LEPROUS", it should return "PELORUS" and "SPORULE". As a dictionary, use [this file](http://code.google.com/p/dotnetperls-controls/downloads/detail?name=enable1.txt), which is a 1.8 mb text-file with one word listed on each line, each word listed in lower-case. In this problem description, I've used upper-case for all words and their anagrams, but that is entirely optional, it's perfectly all right to use lower-case if you want to. 

Using your program, find all the one-word anagrams for "TRIANGLE".

***

*(by the way, in case anyone is curious: a "PELORUS" is "a sighting device on a ship for taking the relative bearings of a distant object", which I imagine basically is a telescope bolted onto a compass, and a "SPORULE" is "a small spore")*

***

Bonus: if you looked up the anagrams for "PAGERS", you'd find that there was actually quite a few of them: "GAPERS", "GASPER", "GRAPES", "PARGES" and "SPARGE". Those five words plus "PAGERS" make a six-word "anagram family". 

Here's another example of an anagram family, this time with five words: "AMBLERS", "BLAMERS", "LAMBERS", "MARBLES" and "RAMBLES".

What is the largest anagram family in the dictionary I supplied? What is the second largest?
