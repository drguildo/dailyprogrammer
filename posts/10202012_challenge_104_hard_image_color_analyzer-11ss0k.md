Sorry for taking the last challenge down but it seems it was already done. I had searched for "slide puzzle" -- what they're usually called -- but not "15 puzzle."

Anyway, new challenge! Make a program that analyzes the color of an image. What the majority colors are, specifically. Output if they fall into red, blue, green, etc. because saying "1 instance of <obscure color here>" takes of space, especially if that obscure color is a blue or red or green.

**Example input:**

`$ color_analyze image.jpg`

**Example output:**

`Pixels that are red: 15`  
`Pixels that are blue: 227`
`Pixels that are green: 1,745`
