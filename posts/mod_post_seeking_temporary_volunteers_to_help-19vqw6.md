I haven't heard from any of the other /r/dailyprogrammer_ideas moderators in weeks, so I'm looking at keeping things going until they come back. The challenge submission queue will be empty after Friday. I'm looking for 1-3 experienced members of /r/dailyprogrammer to help feed it until that happens.

The reason I need help is that I don't have time to submit 3 challenges a week by myself. I'll do what I can, but I can only commit to 3 a month.

The reason I need someone experienced is that the current system is very fragile without /u/rya11111 or /u/nint22. Submissions can't be removed or edited once they're submitted to the queue. I really need to keep mistakes to a minimum. Please don't take it personally if I'm pretty selective on this, it's a difficult position for me. Worst case, I'll keep posting 3 challenges a month.

Please PM me or post here if you're interested. Thanks!
