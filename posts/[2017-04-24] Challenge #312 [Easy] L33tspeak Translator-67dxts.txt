Title: [2017-04-24] Challenge #312 [Easy] L33tspeak Translator

# Description

L33tspeak - the act of speaking like a computer hacker (or hax0r) - was popularized in the late 1990s as a mechanism of abusing ASCII art and character mappings to confuse outsiders. It was a lot of fun. [One popular comic strip](http://megatokyo.com/strip/9) in 2000 showed just how far the joke ran. 

In L33Tspeak you substitute letters for their rough outlines in ASCII characters, e.g. symbols or numbers. You can have 1:1 mappings (like E -&gt; 3) or 1:many mappings (like W -&gt; `//). So then you wind up with words like this:

    BASIC =&gt; 6451C
    ELEET =&gt; 31337 (pronounced elite)
    WOW =&gt; `//0`//
    MOM =&gt; (V)0(V)

## Mappings

For this challenge we'll be using a subset of American Standard Leetspeak:

    A -&gt; 4
    B -&gt; 6
    E -&gt; 3
    I -&gt; 1
    L -&gt; 1
    M -&gt; (V)
    N -&gt; (\)
    O -&gt; 0
    S -&gt; 5
    T -&gt; 7
    V -&gt; \/
    W -&gt; `//

Your challenge, should you choose to accept it, is to translate to and from L33T. 

# Input Description

You'll be given a word or a short phrase, one per line, and asked to convert it from L33T or to L33T. Examples:

    31337 
    storm 

# Output Description

You should emit the translated words: Examples:

    31337 -&gt; eleet
    storm -&gt; 570R(V)
