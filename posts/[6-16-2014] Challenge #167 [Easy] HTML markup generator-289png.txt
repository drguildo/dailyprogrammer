Title: [6/16/2014] Challenge #167 [Easy] HTML markup generator

#Description
You're a well known web-dev with far too much confidence, you mistakingly agreed to complete too many projects in too little a timeframe. In order to fix this, you devise a program that will automatically write all of the HTML for you!

But first, you'll need to program it.

#Formal Inputs &amp; Outputs

##Input description

On standard console input you should be prompted to enter a paragraph.

##Output description

Once your paragraph has been entered, it should be saved as a valid HTML file and opened in your default brower to display the results

#Sample Inputs &amp; Outputs

##Input

    "Enter your paragraph:"
    "This is my paragraph entry"

##Output
(this is the expected content of the .html file)

    &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
    &lt;html&gt;
        &lt;head&gt;
            &lt;title&gt;&lt;/title&gt;
        &lt;/head&gt;

        &lt;body&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;This is my paragraph entry&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/body&gt;
    &lt;/html&gt;

#Bonus

Implement a good looking default CSS style-sheet that also gets automatically generated.
