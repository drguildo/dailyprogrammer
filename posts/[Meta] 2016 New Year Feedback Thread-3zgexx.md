Title: [Meta] 2016 New Year Feedback Thread

Hey folks! As 2016 is starting and we're gearing up for more interesting challenges, we (the mods of /r/dailyprogramming) would like to hear from you! How are we doing?

Are the problems too easy? Too hard? Just right? Boring/exciting? Varied/same? Anything you would like to see us do that we're not doing? Anything we're doing that we should just stop?

Any particular challenges (or types of challenges) that you loved? What about any that you didn't love so much?

Anything you would like to work on, or look into, in the coming year (programming languages, specialty fields like AI, etc)?

Please let us know! Together we can keep the sub great, and maybe make it even better!

Thanks!
