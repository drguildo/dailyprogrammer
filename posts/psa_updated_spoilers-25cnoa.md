Hey folks.

After some suggestions from users about spoilers, we've implemented a new spoiler code that contracts to one line when you aren't hovering over it. This saves a lot of space on the page and hopefully is easier to use. We greatly appreciate your feedback with these sorts of changes so please comment your opinion below. If there are any other changes you think would be suitable just comment those too and we'll give them our consideration.

To use it, just hover over it as before. If you're on a mobile device, tap on it and it should stay open. We realise that some people may not like it or it might not work properly. If this is the case, there's an easy solution for you. Instead of going to www.reddit.com, go to yy.reddit.com ([like this](http://yy.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/)) and the spoilers will act as they did before. If you have any issues with this, [click here to message us](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fdailyprogrammer) and we'll get right on it.

All the best.

- The /r/DailyProgrammer team.
