Title: [2017-09-13] Challenge #331 [Intermediate] Sum of digits of x raised to n

#Description

For some x^n, find the sum of its digits. The solution to this problem is extremely simple. Say, I give you 3^4. You could calculate 3^n and add the digits.

However things might get a bit complex for 5^100. It's a 70-digit  number. You could come up with a larger data type that could handle the product of that number and then you could add each number... but where's the fun in that?

This is today's challenge. Find the sum of the digits of some x^n without directly calculating the number and adding the digits.

Some simple examples with values that you're familiar with:

2^5 = 32 = 3 + 2 = 5

5^3 = 125 = 1 + 2 + 5 = 8

2^7 = 1 + 2 + 8 = 11 

Note that I have not summed the digits of 11. 

We'll work with powers and bases greater than zero. 

# Input Description 

&gt; Base Power

means base^power

&gt; 2 ^ 1000

means 2^1000

# Output Description

Display the sum of the digits of base^power.

# Challenge Input

Edit : If you're unable to come up with an idea, like the one is Project eulers 16, then feel free to solve it using your own data types (if required). Please consider it as the last option.
