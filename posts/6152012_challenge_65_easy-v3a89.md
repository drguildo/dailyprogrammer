Write a program that given a floating point number, gives the number of American dollar coins and bills needed to represent that number (rounded to the nearest 1/100, i.e. the nearest penny). For instance, if the float is 12.33, the result would be 1 ten-dollar bill, 2 one-dollar bills, 1 quarter, 1 nickel and 3 pennies.

For the purposes of this problem, these are the different denominations of the currency and their values:

* Penny: 1 cent
* Nickel: 5 cent
* Dime: 10 cent
* Quarter: 25 cent
* One-dollar bill
* Five-dollar bill
* Ten-dollar bill
* Fifty-dollar bill
* Hundred-dollar bill

Sorry Thomas Jefferson, JFK and Sacagawea, but no two-dollar bills, half-dollars or dollar coins!

Your program can return the result in whatever format it wants, but I recommend just returning a list giving the number each coin or bill needed to make up the change. So, for instance, 12.33 could return [0,0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3] (here the denominations are ordered from most valuable, the hundred-dollar bill, to least valuable, the penny)
