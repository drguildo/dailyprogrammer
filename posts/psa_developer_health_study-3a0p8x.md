Hello,

/u/jmprobert is conducting a Developer Health Study to investigate the physical and mental health of developers. The study survey [can be accessed by clicking here](https://jmprobert.typeform.com/to/LucWmI). Your survey entry is completely anonymous.

This study is organised by /u/jmprobert rather than the /r/DailyProgrammer moderators, so please direct any questions to him instead.

Thanks!
