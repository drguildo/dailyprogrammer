Title: [PSA] The Daily Programmer weekly topics coming soon

As an experiment I will be posting on Sundays-Mondays a sticky thread with a topic for discussion. The main focus of the subreddit is about solving challenges. The weekly topic will focus around how to solve problems or related to the process of solving problems with programs. It could also relate to "how to" like "how to make gifs" of your data. For example.

We have a wealth of experience that can be shared and the weekly sticky will allow you to share and shine in your knowledge.

Also perhaps you can ask a question related to the topic to get some side answers.

We will start next week and see how it goes. I will link the topic posts in our wiki and allow people to find/read past topics.
