Title: [MOD POST] Feedback for future changes; we want to hear from you!

Hey r/DailyProgrammer,

First, as always, **thanks for 12k subscribers and great community involvement**! The mods and I have tons of fun creating challenges and reading through all of your responses. We really do, regardless of comments left or not :-) Keep them coming! We particularly enjoy the obscure but correct code submissions (let's raise our glasses to BF coders).

We're in the process of thinking about changes we would like to introduce to help improve the quality of this subreddit. One of our concerns is the lack of consistent submissions; we are titled r/**Daily**Programmer after all. We're also concerned about overwhelming readers with three challenges at once, since we've noticed one challenge generally gets ignored by the majority. Finally, we're really interested in receiving more challenge-submissions from the community! (/r/dailyprogrammer_ideas is active, but not as much as we would like it to be).

Here are the current proposals (in no particular order) from an internal discussion with the fellow admins:

* Stick to the original system, but be more consistent: 3 challenges posted every Tuesday and Thursday by admins
* Have a queue of approved challenges (submitted by everyone, but reviewed by admins) and have that posted automatically every Tuesday and Thursday
* Reduce the challenges post from 3 (easy, intermediate, and challenging), to 2 (easy-intermediate, and intermediate-challenging)
* Create a long-term challenge (a single month-long challenge that is more about software engineering than algorithms / domain-subject)
* Have only 1 to 2 challenges a week total (posted on the same day)
* Force moderators to submit at least 2 challenges a month, otherwise they loose their mod-rank
* *Write down your own suggestion, we really want to hear from you!*
* Post solutions to problems, in the form of a tutorial (i.e. code & explanation)
* Actually declare three kinds of winner per challenge: most "correct", most "unique", and most "tiny"
* A flare or prize for winners

For some of these suggestions, we want to give extra-clarification:

* For the long-term challenges, we will actually judge all submissions, based on a set of requirements not yet defined.
* For automatic-submission, we will accept all challenge submissions through a form ([this is our current testing form](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dExyN0gxT05CWms4UC1FeDdOYUtUYnc6MQ#gid=0)), then manually approve them, and then have them posted based on other changes explained above. (i.e. once a week, 2 per week, etc.)

So, with all of this said, let us know what you think! Again, we really do want to hear from you, so write down any idea or suggestion you have!
