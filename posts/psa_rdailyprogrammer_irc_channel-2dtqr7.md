We now have an IRC channel for all things /r/DailyProgrammer! You can find us at **irc.freenode.net** in **#reddit-dailyprogrammer**. You can use your favourite IRC client (such as mIRC on Windows, or irssi on Linux) or, if you'd prefer, use the webchat at http://webchat.freenode.net/.

If you have any IRC-related queries or suggestions, as always post them here or poke us in the mod mail. Enjoy!
