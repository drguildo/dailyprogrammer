#**Description**

A [Latin square](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_square) is an n × n array filled with n different symbols, each occurring exactly once in each row and exactly once in each column.


For example:

>1

And,

>1 2

>2 1

Another one, 

>1 2 3 

>3 1 2

>2 3 1

In this challenge, you have to check whether a given array is a Latin square. 

#**Input Description**

Let the user enter the length of the array followed by *n x n* numbers. Fill an array from left to right starting from above. 

#**Output Description**

If it is a Latin square, then display true. Else, display false. 

#**Challenge Input**

> 5 

> 1 2 3 4 5 5 1 2 3 4 4 5 1 2 3 3 4 5 1 2 2 3 4 5 1

> 2

> 1 3 3 4

> 4

> 1 2 3 4 1 3 2 4 2 3 4 1 4 3 2 1 

#**Challenge Output**

>  true

> false

> false

#**Bonus**

A Latin square is said to be reduced if both its first row and its first column are in their natural order.

You can reduce a Latin square by reordering the rows and columns. The example in the description can be reduced to this

>1 2 3

>2 3 1

>3 1 2

If a given array turns out to be a Latin square, then your program should reduce it and display it. 

Edit: /u/tomekanco has pointed out that many solutions which have an error. I shall look into this. Meanwhile, I have added an extra challenge input-output for you to check.
