Title: [2021-05-03] Challenge #388 [Intermediate] Next palindrome

A palindrome is a whole number that's the same when read backward in base 10, such as 12321 or 9449.

Given a positive whole number, find the smallest palindrome greater than the given number.

    nextpal(808) =&gt; 818
    nextpal(999) =&gt; 1001
    nextpal(2133) =&gt; 2222

For large inputs, your solution must be much more efficient than incrementing and checking each subsequent number to see if it's a palindrome. Find nextpal(3^(39)) before posting your solution. Depending on your programming language, it should take a fraction of a second.
