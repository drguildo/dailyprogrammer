This one is inspired by an actual problem my friend had to deal with recently.  Unfortunately, its a little bit
keyboard-locale specific, so if you don't happen to use a us-EN layout keyboard you might want to get a picture of one.

The en-us keyboard layout [pictured here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:KB_United_States-NoAltGr.svg) is one common layout
for keys.  There are character-generating keys such as '1' and 'q', as well as modifier keys like 'ctrl' and 'shift', and 'caps-lock'

If one were to press every one of the character-generating keys in order from top to bottom left-to-right, 
you would get the following string:

    `1234567890-=qwertyuiop[]\asdfghjkl;'zxcvbnm,./

plus the whitespace characters TAB,RETURN,SPACE.

Your job is to write a function that takes in a character representing a keypress, as well as a boolean for
each 'modifier' key like ctrl,alt,shift,and caps lock, and converts it properly into the ascii character for which
the key gets output.

For example, my python implementation keytochar(key='a',caps=True) returns 'A'.  However, keytochar(key='a',caps=True,shift=True) returns 'a'.

BONUS:
Read in a string containing a record of keypresses and output them to the correct string.  A status key change
is indicated by a ^ character..if a ^ character is detected, then the next character is either an 's' or 'S' for shift pressed
or shift released, respectively, a 'c' or 'C' for caps on or caps off respectively, and a 't' 'T' for control down or up, and 'a' 'A' for alt down or up.

For example on the bonus, given the input

    ^sm^Sy e-mail address ^s9^Sto send the ^s444^S to^s0^S is ^cfake^s2^Sgmail.com^C

you should output

    My e-mail address (to send the $$$ to) is FAKE@GMAIL.COM
