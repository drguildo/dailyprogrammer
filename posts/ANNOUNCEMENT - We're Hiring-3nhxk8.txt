Title: ANNOUNCEMENT - We're Hiring

**UPDATE**

new moderators have been identified and you'll see them in coming weeks.  

# We're Hiring

Hiring moderators, that is. Moderating for /r/DailyProgrammer is not a walk in the park. Each challenge written must be as suitable as possible for as many people as possible, not to mention other work aside from writing challenges. We run a close-knit team of mods here, and sometimes we're rushing around on weeknights trying to get the daily challenge out on time! Therefore we think that adding two or three extra members to the team would be helpful for all involved, as you'll get more varied and fleshed-out challenges.
Your role as a moderator will include:

* Being able to write your share of the challenges reliably and somewhat predictably on-time.
* Having good English writing and communication skills; explaining challenges well is not as easy as it seems.
* Being a competent computer programmer. Your language of choice is irrelevant; the universal skills are the important part.
( Writing challenges that are challenging and interesting, while still being solvable and enjoyable, to as many people as possible. (To extend on this, a good knowledge of reddit's Markdown is important.)
* Being able to help users via the moderator mail system, and handle unsuitable user comments responsibly and maturely.

Having the experience of writing challenges could be a great thing to include in a job application; it shows you have the skills to not only solve the challenges, but to formulate them effectively and clearly. If you think you have what it takes, read on!

# Application

We're not going to make the application too formal. We want a few things in the application:

- **Past programming evidence.** Evidence of past projects, existing solutions to DailyProgrammer and examples of contributions to open-source projects are the sort of stuff we're looking for. We don't want a great big portfolio of your work; something such as a link to a GitHub/GitLab/BitBucket/Codeplex profile would be ideal, so we can see the sort of stuff you've done.
- **Prior challenge submission.** We need an example of the sort of challenge that you are capable of writing. Head on over to /r/DailyProgrammer_Ideas and show us what you can do! Include a link to your challenge in your application - remember to read the sidebar in that subreddit to submit your challenge correctly. If you've already submitted a challenge in the past, you can just link to that one instead, rather than writing another one.
- **Availability.** We don't ask too much of you - a few of hours of your time per week should be enough! Give us a brief overview of when you'll be available or not.
- **General programming/academic experience.** A sentence or two describing the programming languages you enjoy/work with, any relevant qualifications, and anything in the world of programming, tech and CS that interests you. This isn't really necessary, so omit it if you want, but we'll be able to get a better understanding of who you are. If you have a programming-related blog or anything similar, we'd love to check it out!

Submit a comment on this post including the above stuff, we'll have a read through them, and we'll get in touch shortly. We're looking for around two or three members here, so don't feel at all bad if you don't get a response. We'll put you onto the shortlist for next time!
