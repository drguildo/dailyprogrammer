Hey programmers.

I have a quick apology to make on my own behalf. For the past few weeks the challenges that I (/u/Elite6809) have put out have not been fully up to scratch by my own standards. This is because I made the mistake of choosing to submit challenges during the time I had exams. I tried to put out quality, engaging challenges during this time but coming up with a good quality challenge for this subreddit can easily take hours each. My revision got in the way of this meaning I've had to submit challenges which may have not engaged you as well as they should have.

My last exam is tomorrow meaning from then I'll have loads of time to write new challenges. For this reason I've decided to restart this week's challenges on Friday and Saturday, and I'll try and get an Easy, Medium and Hard challenge out over the weekend so you'll have plenty to get your teeth into. 

This is 100% my own fault and I apologise again.
