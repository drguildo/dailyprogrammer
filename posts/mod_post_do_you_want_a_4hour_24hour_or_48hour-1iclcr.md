Hey r/DailyProgrammers!

I've been getting a few PMs about organizing a short-term programming challenge event this summer: these are stand-alone sets of challenges that we all do together (through this subreddit) over the course of a planned range of time. Some have recommended short events, around 4 hours, or weekend-long events, like a 48-hour format. What are your thoughts or opinions on this? The subreddit will continue posting normally, regardless of this event happening.

I'm leaning towards formatting it very much like the [ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACM_International_Collegiate_Programming_Contest): teams of one to three people (but with only **one** computer!) are given a set of challenges and whomever completes the most at the end of the allotted time wins! Not sure what the prize could be, but either Reddit Gold (so both you and Reddit win) or something equally fun! Note that the set of challenges would likely have mostly [Easy], two [Mediums], and one [Hard]. None of them will require any tools or resources outside of the minimal programming entertainment (aka: no graphics, no networking, etc.)

I'd like for this to be after the beginning of August; I'm short on time until then.

Tell us: what do you think?
