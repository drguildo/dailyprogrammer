Hi all! 

Just a quick update on some recent events and news for /r/dailyprogrammer and also a chance for you to help out with a small project.


#New Mods

You probably noticed by now some fresh activity with the subreddit. 3 New moderators were added to the team in March.

* /u/professorlamp
* /u/Elite6809
* /u/Coder_d00d

Much like on the planet Dune where the spice must flow, so shall the challenges here on /r/dailyprogrammer. 

#Wiki Project

The sidebar is full of good information about /r/dailyprogrammer. On some consideration we could move most of it to the subreddit's wiki and link people to that to read up on the subreddit and have more room to add more data. It will also streamline the sidebar a bit. This will be worked on in the coming weeks.


#We need links.

Part of the above wiki work I am looking for other programming related subreddits. I want to try to connect users of this subreddit to other great subreddits that are related to programming. If you have a few moments, please consider posting below some of the programming related subreddits you also like/use/know about that I can add to the wiki to help direct members of /r/dailyprogrammer to check out.

#Plug for ideas

As always check out /r/DailyProgrammer_Ideas to submit ideas. We could use some more [Hard] challenge ideas. Thank you to all who submit ideas.

#The Future

We will continue to post challenges weekly and work to improve the quality of /r/dailyprogrammer. Thanks to the all the redditors who participate in the subreddit and make this a fun and good community on reddit.
