If you've never heard of it before, LD is a game development competition where you write and finish a game in 48 hours. They give you the theme for the game at the start time. A lot of popular faces participate in this and finishing an LD is something to be proud of. I'll be (attempting to) doing it and I hope you'll all join me!
