Title: [2017-08-7] Challenge #326 [Easy] Nearest Prime Numbers


# Description

A prime number is any integer greater than 1 which can only be evenly divided by 1 or itself. For this challenge, you will output two numbers: the nearest prime below the input, and the nearest prime above it.

# Input Description 

The input will be a number on each line, called *n*.

# Output Description 

The format of the output will be:  
&gt; *p1 &lt; n &lt; p2*

where *p1* is the smaller prime, *p2* is the larger prime and *n* is the input.

If *n* already is a prime, the output will be:  
&gt;*n* is prime.

# Challenge Input

	270  
	541  
	993  
	649

# Challenge Output

	269 &lt; 270 &lt; 271  
	541 is prime.  
	991 &lt; 993 &lt; 997  
	647 &lt; 649 &lt; 653

# Bonus

Write the program to work for numbers with big gaps to the nearest primes. This requires a clever solution and cannot be efficiently bruteforced.
